/*
When we define a function in the hypothesis stage ie. what the function is supposed to do, then the signature of the function is defined/decided. 
Once the signature of the function is defined/decided , then the function will work as defined in the hypothesis stage.

We try to print N to 1. 

We first tried to print 1 to N , now we will try to print N to 1.
To print values 1 to N , during designing the hypothesis  , we called the print() method & passed it value N & in return it will print 1 to N.
If we run the same print() method with value N-1 ie. print(N-1) , then based on the definition of the method print() , it will print 1 to N-1.

/*
In input we are provided with an array of integers and we have to sort this array using recursion.
Lets say we have an array arr[] = {2 3 7 6 4 5 9}
We need to give the sorted array in output ie. arr[] = {2 3 4 5 6 7 9}

We identify a recursive problem if we are provided with choices & we can take decisions on these provided choices.

In the array arr[] = {2 3 7 6 4 5 9} , we can see its a recursive problem , hence we can try 2 methods to solve this problem.
1. We check if we are able to take decisions on this array to sort it. If we are unable to take decisions on the array then we use
method 2.
2. We try to make the input smaller

So we want to make the array sorted ie. arr[] = {2 3 4 5 6 7 9}

Now for this array , the decision making process is not clear/intuitive , hence we use method 2 ie. making the input smaller.
